## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---> :) I'm currently a student at the University of California, San Diego.
  
---> :D Iâ€™m building a data-driven fantasy sports dashboard that pulls real sportsbook odds and Prize Pick Lines, calculates which bets have a positive EV, and displays them in a real-time web interface. Itâ€™s a full-stack app using Node.js/Express for the API, SQL for storage, React for the UI, and Docker/AWS for deployment.

- :disappointed_relieved: but first I need to learn GitHub and other stuff.
